Glow AI ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

Please read this privacy policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Personal Information

When you use our App, we may collect the following personal information:

- **Account Information:** First name, age, gender, and ethnicity (optional)

### User Images and Face Data

Our App collects and processes facial images that you provide through:

- **Camera Capture:** Photos taken directly within the App
- **Photo Library:** Images you upload from your device's photo library

**How Your Images Are Used:**

- **AI Skin Analysis:** Your facial images are analyzed using artificial intelligence to assess skin health, identify concerns (acne, dark spots, wrinkles, etc.), and generate a personalized skin health score

**Important:** Your facial images are sent to third-party AI services (OpenAI) for analysis. By using the App, you consent to this transfer.

**Why We Store Face Data:**

We store your facial images so that we can display a history of images you have taken in the App, allowing you to view and track your skin health journey over time.

**Face Data Retention Period:**

Your facial images are stored for as long as your account exists. When you delete your account, all facial images and associated face data are permanently deleted from our servers.
